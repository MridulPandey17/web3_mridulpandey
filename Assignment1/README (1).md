# Hashing

This program uses python language to hash the string taken as input
from the user. The string is incremented by numbers till its hash value is
lower than: 0x00000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

Along with this time library is imported to calculate the time taken 
to find the 1st hash value for the string increment system. 

I had imported hashlib to use SHA 256 which was used to produce the required hashing value.
