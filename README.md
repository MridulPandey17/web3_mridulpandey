# Loan Services

This program uses object oriented programming for creating loan
sevices including lenders and borrowers.
I have used python language in this program.

To start with the program import loan from loanfinal
The program starts with creating a class named loan and is followed
by defining the constructors storing the personal details of the user
i.e. the object. Then the user is asked to choose if he or she is
the lender or the borrower. 

The lenders and the borrowers are further divided into different
groups based to the money bracket they lie in. After choosing
their money bracket (l1, l2, l3, l4, l5), the users are asked to 
enter the exact amount of money they want/want to give , and are 
given the interest rates that will be used. Following this they have 
many functions at their hand, they can recheck their interest rates, 
the time for which they have borrowed/lent the money. The total money
that they will have to give/get at the end of the time duration. 
Also this program allows the user to simultaneously be the borrower in
one the lender in other.
Also for lenders there is a loan pool for aech group, so borrowers can 
lend money only as long as they are within the lender pool of 
that particular group.


The above loaning system is decentalized. 
Demerits of centralized systems:
1. slow in reacting to change as only one group of people handle
the company so it takes time to change everything.
2. low power of non core employees, and therefore low on 
diversity of thoughts and therefore resulting in narrow horizon 
of vision.
3. Kind of dictator model, therefore opposite to democracy.
4. with majority of people not having say in decision making, it leads to
high dissatisfaction rates and therefore not very sensitive to the 
demands of the the people.
